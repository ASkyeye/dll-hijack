# Version.dll Hijack Source Template

This is a *template*. Copy `src\DoPatch.sample.cpp` to `src\DoPatch.cpp` and do your coding there.

This project was created with Visual Studio 2015. You may get it working with previous version of Visual Studio.

Other compiler such as `gcc` is not recommended; as it will require extra dependencies such as `msys-2.0.dll` or `cygwin1.dll`.. Maybe is just me don't know how to static build it :<
